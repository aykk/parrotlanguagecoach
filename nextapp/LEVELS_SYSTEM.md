- **XP System**: Earn XP based on performance, session duration, and difficulty
- **Level Progression**: Visual progress bars and unlockable features
- **Dynamic Titles**: Each level has unique title and description

### 2. **Advanced Progress Tracking**
- **Detailed Session Data**: Tracks accuracy, pronunciation, fluency, weak phonemes, practiced words, session duration
- **Weak Areas Analysis**: Automatically identifies phonemes and words with <60% success rate
- **Mastered Skills**: Tracks phonemes and words with >80% success rate
- **Streak Tracking**: Calculates consecutive practice days
- **Performance Analytics**: Comprehensive statistics and trends

### 3. **Adaptive Difficulty System**
- **Performance-Based Adjustment**: Difficulty automatically adjusts based on user's average scores
- **Smart Recommendations**: Suggests specific phonemes and words to practice
- **Personalized Content**: Recommends harder phrases for high performers, easier ones for struggling users
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Updates recommendations after each session

### 4. **Enhanced Dashboard**
- **Level Display**: Shows current level, XP, progress to next level
- **Weak Areas Section**: Highlights phonemes and words needing improvement
- **Mastered Skills**: Celebrates achievements and mastered content
- **Recent Sessions**: Detailed history of practice attempts
- **Performance Metrics**: Visual progress bars and statistics

## ðŸŽ® How the Level System Works

### XP Calculation
```typescript
XP = Base XP (10) + 
     Accuracy Bonus (score/10) + 
     Fluency Bonus (score/20) + 
     Duration Bonus (seconds/30) + 
     Difficulty Bonus (weak phonemes Ã— 2)
```

### Level Requirements
- **Level 1 (Beginner)**: 0 XP - Basic phrases, simple words
- **Level 2 (Novice)**: 100 XP - Common phrases, basic phonemes  
- **Level 3 (Apprentice)**: 250 XP - Intermediate phrases, complex words
- **Level 4 (Practitioner)**: 500 XP - Advanced phrases, idioms
- **Level 5 (Expert)**: 1000 XP - Expert phrases, all phonemes
- **Level 6 (Master)**: 2000 XP - Master phrases, accent training

### Adaptive Difficulty Algorithm
- **90%+ Average Score**: Difficulty 8-10 (Expert level)
- **80-89% Average Score**: Difficulty 7-9 (Advanced)
- **70-79% Average Score**: Difficulty 6-8 (Intermediate)
- **60-69% Average Score**: Difficulty 5 (Standard)
- **<60% Average Score**: Difficulty 1-3 (Beginner)

## ðŸ“Š Database Schema Updates

### pronunciation_sessions
```sql
- weak_phonemes: TEXT[] (array of difficult phonemes)
- practiced_words: TEXT[] (array of words practiced)
- session_duration: DECIMAL(8,2) (session length in seconds)
```

### user_progress
```sql
- current_level: INTEGER (user's current level)
- total_xp: INTEGER (total experience points)
- weak_phonemes: TEXT[] (phonemes needing work)
- mastered_phonemes: TEXT[] (mastered phonemes)
- weak_words: TEXT[] (difficult words)
- mastered_words: TEXT[] (mastered words)
```
